# CPU Scheduler Simulator - Project Summary

## Project Overview

**Name**: Advanced CPU Scheduler Simulator  
**Type**: Operating Systems Course Project  
**Language**: C++17  
**Platform**: FreeBSD/Unix  
**Status**: Complete and Production-Ready  

## What This Project Does

This is a comprehensive simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms used in modern operating systems. It demonstrates how different scheduling policies affect system performance through:

- **Live Simulation**: Executes processes through various scheduling algorithms
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates waiting time, turnaround time, response time, and more
- **Visual Output**: Gantt charts showing process execution timelines
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of all algorithms

## Implemented Algorithms (Meeting All Requirements)

### 1. Round Robin (RR)
- **Type**: Preemptive scheduling
- **Key Feature**: Configurable time quantum
- **Use Case**: Time-sharing systems
- **Implementation**: Circular FIFO queue with quantum-based preemption

### 2. Priority Scheduling (Both Modes)
- **Non-Preemptive**: Runs processes to completion based on priority
- **Preemptive**: Can interrupt lower-priority processes
- **Key Feature**: Aging mechanism to prevent starvation
- **Use Case**: Real-time and critical process management

### 3. Multilevel Queue (MLQ)
- **Type**: Multiple ready queues with different policies
- **Key Feature**: Processes permanently assigned to queues
- **Configuration**: Each queue can use RR or FCFS
- **Use Case**: Systems with distinct process classes (foreground/background)

### 4. Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- **Type**: Dynamic priority adjustment
- **Key Feature**: Processes move between queues based on behavior
- **Innovation**: Automatic CPU-bound vs I/O-bound detection
- **Use Case**: General-purpose OS (most modern systems)

## Key Features Implemented

- Multiple scheduling algorithms
- Process creation with priorities, burst times, arrival times
